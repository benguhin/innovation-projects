# Austin's Open Government Commitments for 2018-2019

> Help us make commitments to up our game in transparency, civic engagement, accountability, and technology innovation.

The City of Austin is preparing to co-create a new set of 3-5 commitments as part of our membership in the international Open Government Partnership. These projects will improve our transparency, community engagement, accountability, and technology/innovation. 

Here you will find information on how to contribute your ideas for commitment topics for our open government projects in 2018-2019.

We will open a call for commitment topics in May 2018. To receive updates and announcements when the call is opened, or to just keep in touch with these open government commitments for Austin, [sign up for our email list](/projects/OpenGov2018/Open Government Commitments 2018/contact). 

## About the Open Government Partnership

The Open Government Partnership is an international organization of member nations dedicated to improving government accountability, transparency, community engagement, and technology practices. The City of Austin joined this partnership in 2016 as one of its first local government members -- the only local government in the United States. We committed to [5 projects for 2017](https://opengovpartnership.bloomfire.com/?feed=recent), including homelessness, equity, and transparency, culminating with an [Open Government Showcase](https://medium.com/civiqueso/civic-participation-initiatives-the-city-of-austin-open-government-showcase-9be319e6c9d9) in December 2017. 

In 2018, the Open Government Partnership invited Austin to continue our participation by making commitments to 3-5 new projects that advance open government principles.
