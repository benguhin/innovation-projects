# City Services Workflow

We've completed a content inventory, focusing on the pages where residents learn about compost, recycling, and trash services. We found that the majority of pages on the site are informative. This is not very surprising, because we already know that educating the community is one of Austin Resource Recovery's strengths.

However, the most popular pages were actually those that had an interactive feature for Austin residents, such as:

* An app that lets residents find out their curbside trash and recycling schedules,

* A form to sign-up for reminders,

* And an interactive map to find drop-off centers.

These interactive pages were focused more on accessing a specific service relating to composting, trash, or recycling instead of gathering information about the department.

We start user testing this week. We're testing our hypothesis that residents are more interested in the service offered by a department than in the department itself. We're also testing the first city services workflow prototype with one of our advisory team members who is responsible for creating a lot of digital content.
