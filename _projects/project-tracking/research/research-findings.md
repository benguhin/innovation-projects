Here’s what we’ve learned about project tracking from public stakeholders and City staff. [Read more about our research process here.](http://projects.austintexas.io/projects/project-tracking/research/research-methods/)

## What we've learned from community members

### People know local government matters
They have many motivations for getting involved in civic issues, some based on civic responsibility reasons, some based on the desire to impact issues of personal relevance and practicality to people.

### People see the City as the primary source for information but the website and system is complex and alienating

People go to the City because they see it as a primary source for information on public services. But they find the city’s information and website confusing and overwhelming.

Not only is the city website confusing, but how the City operates is complex, confusing and alienating--even for people who have worked closely on City issues or served on citizen boards.

Community advocates perceive that city staff are sometimes fearful or uncertain of what information they can/should share. This contributes to the difficulty of navigating the system and finding the information people want.
