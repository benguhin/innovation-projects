        <p>The City of Austin consists of 40+ departments and over 13,000 employees serving almost 1 million people. There are tons of City-sponsored projects going on at any given moment in time – street resurfacing, park improvements, service delivery, and research, to name a few. It can be challenging for people in Austin to know what projects are going on relevant to them, what their status is, and how they can learn more (or even participate). City staff often face the same challenge. Because many of Austin’s challenges cross departmental lines–such as housing affordability, which involves at least half a dozen departments–many employees need easier access to information on other City projects that relate to their work.</p>

<p>This project seeks to make it easier for people in Austin to have a sense of what projects the City is working on, the state of progress of those projects, how the projects relate to critical goals, and how they are funded. More specifically, we are committing to build an online project tracking tool people can use to find this information.</p>

<p>We made a commitment to build and test a project tracking tool as part of our participation in the <a href="https://opengovpartnership.bloomfire.com/posts/1315600-austin-s-open-government-partnership-action-plan">Open Government Partnership subnational pilot program</a>. In short, we committed to up the City of Austin’s game in transparency, civic participation, accountability, and technology innovation.</p>

<p>We’re also following in the footsteps of other governments around the world who have invested in platforms to let people track projects. Here are a few examples:</p>

<h2 id="mexico">Mexico</h2>

<p>Mexico created a <a href="http://tablero.gobabiertomx.org/">tracking interface</a> to share updates on its commitments as part of the Open Government Partnership.</p>

<p><img src="/uploads/Project%20tracking%20-%20Mexico.png" alt="Mexico's project tracking tool, titled &quot;Tablero&quot;. The interface shows open government commitments Mexico has made  and where they are in the process." /></p>

<h2 id="uk-government-digital-service">UK Government Digital Service</h2>

<p>The United Kingdom’s Government Digital Service created a <a href="https://www.gov.uk/transformation/exemplars">dashboard</a> to show the status of its digital services projects in stages of agile development.
<img src="/uploads/UK%20GDS%20transformation.png" alt="UK Government Digital Service projects dashboard. Site shows projects at different stages of agile development process: Discovery (user needs are researched and identified), Alpha (A core service is built to meet the main user needs), Beta (The service is improved, then tested in public), and Live (The service is public and works well. It’ll be continually improved to meet user needs). The site provides links to more information on each project at each stage." /></p>

<h2 id="ontario-canada">Ontario, Canada</h2>

<p>Ontario, Canada is <a href="https://www.ontario.ca/page/open-government-project-tracker">tracking</a> its own Open Government Partnership commitments by their stage in implementation.</p>

<p><img src="/uploads/Ontario%20project%20tracker.png" alt="Ontario's open government project tracker. Site shows different open government projects by their stage of completion: Planning (projects are being researched), Developing (project is being developed and designed), Implementing (projects are being executed), and Complete (projects have been completed). The site provides links to more information on each project at each stage." /></p>
