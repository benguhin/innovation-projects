## The Project

In Austin, there are over 2,000 individuals without a safe place to sleep. There are many reasons a person can become homeless. It can range from the lack of affordable housing to the loss of family and community.

Mayor Steve Adler and the [City of Austin](https://austintexas.gov/) hopes to address this very issue. 
In 2016, the [Design, Technology and Innovation Fellows](https://cityofaustin.github.io/innovation-fellows/) secured a grant from [Bloomberg Philanthropies](https://www.bloomberg.org/program/government-innovation/innovation-teams/#overview), which is funding innovation teams (i-teams) in over 20 cities worldwide to tackle urban problems and deliver better solutions for residents. 

With this grant, the Austin i-team is working with service providers and individuals experiencing homelessness to gain a better understanding of the situation and the people involved. The goal is to achieve functional zero in 10 years. We hope the research and design findings will bring Austin’s homeless a step closer to home. 


## iTeam Grant Requirements

The purpose of the grant is to add an innovation capacity to a city. Grant funds may only be used for salaries and benefits, and for expenses related to the iTeam’s work. Teams are expected to go through a rigorous process of framing problems before engaging in solutioning or connecting to ideas.

## The Plan

### Phase 1 - Discovery - conduct research in 3 parallel streams: 

1. **Ethnographic Study**: Interviews with those with lived experience of homelessness, service providers, and community members to learn more about their experience and perspectives. 
2. **Quantitative Research**: Inventory data to identify areas of opportunity for better integration, knowledge sharing, and potential investments. 
3. **ARCH Service Mapping**: Understanding the experience of people with lived experience in Austin, the role that the ARCH plays in their experience, and a service blueprint for the Austin Resource Center for the Homeless (ARCH). 

After the initial research, we’ll pull together insights based on what we’ve learned and our recommendations for moving forward. 

### Phase 2 - Concepting & Prototyping

During this stage, we’ll begin designing and prototyping options for how to achieve the project’s desired outcomes. We’ll develop options based on the information gathered during the Discovery stage and test them with different types of users to understand how they work well and how they can be improved. This might include designing and testing different user interfaces, ways of providing geographic information about organizations, and internal administration of the system.

## Scope of Work

The project will be 7-months long and consist of several design sprints.  The design sprints in 2017 have consisted of three phases over a short period of time: Research, Discovery, and Synthesis. 

During the Research and Discovery phase, the i-team 
* Met with stakeholders to better understand the path of homelessness and services offered by the city to aid those experiencing homelessness. 
* Held interviews with individuals who are experiencing or who had experience homelessness, case managers, and service providers within the downtown area and outside the city limits. 
* Conducted ride alongs with the Emergency Medical Services and Homeless Outreach Street Team.
* Visited and mapped the service of various locations that housed individuals both permanently and temporarily, and performed observations at various shelters. 
* Participated in two pop-ups conducted by the HOST team at the ARCH in September and Terrazas library in November. 
* Gathered and synthesized data from stakeholders on demographics, services, and client behaviours.
* Launched a lived experience advisory group who have experienced or are currently experiencing homelessness to share stories, obtain feedback and learnings to inform policy makers, and find solutions by creating it with those who know the situation best.
