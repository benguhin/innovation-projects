**We’re building living digital services that grow, adapt, and improve with user needs.**

City of Austin services include everything from looking up recycling and trash schedules to registering kids for summer camp. As more Austin residents come to rely on mobile devices to accomplish their day-to-day tasks, the ability to access the City’s services online has become imperative. That’s why it is of utmost importance to address these needs by expanding and improving the our digital services.

The Austin Digital Services Discovery Project is a partnership between two City departments, [Communications Public Information](http://www.austintexas.gov/department/communications) and [Communications and Technology Management](http://www.austintexas.gov/department/information-technology), and the [Design, Technology, and Innovation Fellows](https://cityofaustin.github.io/innovation-fellows/). We set out to learn what’s working for other government service providers, then embark on an iterative research, prototyping, and testing process to identify new designs, methods, and technologies. 

This site is an overview of our approach, shared learnings, and progress we’ve made. If you have questions or comments, [we’d love to hear from you](austin-digital-services-discovery/about/contact/).
