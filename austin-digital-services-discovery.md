City of Austin digital services include viewing Austin recycling and trash schedules, getting in line for your driver’s license, registering your kids for summer camp, and other goals residents can accomplish–online. Austin residents rely on digital services more and more every day and city teams realize how important it is to meet their expectations. During the 2017 spring retreat, Austin’s City Council cited the importance of creating government that works for everyone. The Design, Technology, & Innovation Fellows partnered with two City of Austin departments: Communications & Information Management and Communications & Technology Management, to learn what’s not working about our current website and to define, and more importantly- test new methods for developing and accessing City of Austin digital services. Also key is building a more agile technology foundation.

This is an overview of our approach, shared learnings, and progress we’ve made. If you have questions or comments, we want to hear from you:
