## Background of the Homelessness Advisory Committee of Austin (HACA)

Homelessness is an increasingly visible problem in Austin. As the city continues to grow and prosper some long-time Austinites are being displaced and some people who have been living on the edge in other parts of the country arrive seeking opportunities in a prosperous metropolis. Many non-profit and public entities have risen to the challenge and are looking for better ways to coordinate resources but one voice has been missing: people with lived experience of homelessness.  

In October 2017, the iTeam created the Homelessness Advisory Committee of Austin (HACA) made of 13 members with past or current experiences of homelessness to assist with the development of research tools, consult on findings, and validate or test possible solutions.

## Activities
Since the formation of the group in October the group has meet several times. In these meetings the members have shared their stories, created journey maps, discussed communication needs, developed prototypes, and provided input on City resolutions. The group has also voted to adopt bylaws that establish term-limits and process for recruiting and adding new members. The group also has set up a closed facebook group for members to discuss issues with each other and pose questions directly to the organizers. The organizers are currently recruiting for a second orientation session and are continuing to work with service providers to recruit an experientially and demographically diverse group of new members. 

Below are a summary of the activities that we have conducted with the group since its inception. The participants meet twice a month for two hours and are compensated for their time.

## Future Needs

The Advisory Committee is a necessary credibility check for policy makers and service providers in the City of Austin. It gives voice and representation to the an underrepresented community in Austin and provides a forum for inclusion. Since the group’s inception, the iTeam has worked closely with staff from the Ending Community Homelessness Coalition (ECHO) and Austin Public Health to incorporate public and private stakeholders into the process and plan for the group’s transition when this phase of the iTeam’s project ends in mid-2018.
