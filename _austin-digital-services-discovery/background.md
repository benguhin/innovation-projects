In May, 2017, our team got together to gather requirements, evaluate, and then implement a new technology foundation or “stack” for all City of Austin services. Following in the well-documented footsteps of other innovative cities like [Boston](https://www.boston.gov/departments/digital-team) and [Indianapolis](https://shift.indy.gov/), and international governments like the [United Kingdom](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/government-digital-service), we discovered we needed more than a technology foundation–we needed shared values, a roadmap for reaching our goals, the teams in place to do the work and new workflows to support them.

We interviewed City of Austin technology decision makers and implementers in their work spaces–gaining an understanding of their challenges when managing digital services. We wrapped initial discovery then made a strategic decision to break our big tech project into three smaller project segments:

* Developing a Digital Service Strategy and Roadmap: developing shared values and tools for approaching, evaluating, and implementing digital services.
* City Services Workflow: designing, developing, and testing a new service-oriented web experience with and for residents and city employees.
* Shared Microservice: designing, developing, and testing a shared service, like payments or forms, that would serve many residents and departments across Austin.
