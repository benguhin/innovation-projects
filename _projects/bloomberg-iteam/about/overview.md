## The Project

In Austin, there are over 2,000 individuals without a safe place to sleep. There are many reasons a person can become homeless. It can range from the lack of affordable housing to the loss of family and community.

Mayor Steve Adler and the [City of Austin](https://austintexas.gov/) hopes to address this very issue. 
In 2016, the [Design, Technology and Innovation Fellows](https://cityofaustin.github.io/innovation-fellows/) secured a grant from [Bloomberg Philanthropies](https://www.bloomberg.org/program/government-innovation/innovation-teams/#overview), which is funding innovation teams (i-teams) in over 20 cities worldwide to tackle urban problems and deliver better solutions for residents. 

With this grant, the Austin i-team is working with service providers and individuals experiencing homelessness to gain a better understanding of the situation and the people involved. The goal is to achieve functional zero in 10 years. We hope the research and design findings will bring Austin’s homeless a step closer to home. 


## iTeam Grant Requirements

The purpose of the grant is to add an innovation capacity to a city. Grant funds may only be used for salaries and benefits, and for expenses related to the iTeam’s work. Teams are expected to go through a rigorous process of framing problems before engaging in solutioning or connecting to ideas.

## The Plan

### Phase 1 - Discovery - conduct research in 3 parallel streams: 

1. **Ethnographic Study**: Interviews with those with lived experience of homelessness, service providers, and community members to learn more about their experience and perspectives. 
2. **Quantitative Research**: Inventory data to identify areas of opportunity for better integration, knowledge sharing, and potential investments. 
3. **ARCH Service Mapping**: Understanding the experience of people with lived experience in Austin, the role that the ARCH plays in their experience, and a service blueprint for the Austin Resource Center for the Homeless (ARCH). 

After the initial research, we’ll pull together insights based on what we’ve learned and our recommendations for moving forward. 

### Phase 2 - Concepting & Prototyping

During this stage, we’ll begin designing and prototyping options for how to achieve the project’s desired outcomes. We’ll develop options based on the information gathered during the Discovery stage and test them with different types of users to understand how they work well and how they can be improved. This might include designing and testing different user interfaces, ways of providing geographic information about organizations, and internal administration of the system.
