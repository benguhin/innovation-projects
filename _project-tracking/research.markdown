## Desk Research

Got a cursory understanding of existing project tracking tools, processes, and capabilities for City of Austin projects, as well as practices and tools used by other governments.

Understand current City project tracking capabilities:

* What project tracking tools and project management systems currently exist at the City?

* Who and how many are using existing public facing project reporting/tracking tools (CIVIC, new Bond Tool?, etc.)?

* What project information/data are City staff already collecting?

* How many “smart” and open government projects are active, planned or completed at the City of Austin?

* How might we bin departments/offices by current capabilities and infrastructure?

Competitive Analysis: “Best in class” - what online portfolio management/project tracking tools are already out there? Ex. UK, Canada, Mexico, etc.

## Field Research

Conducted in-person interviews with City of Austin staff and members of the public to understand needs, desires, and capabilities for tracking project information.

* *City staff interviews*: Conducted 3 group discussions with City staff (7-10 per interview) from various departments in June 2017.

* *Public stakeholder interviews (currently in progress)*: Will conduct 8-12 interviews in July-August 2017 with community members active in local issues. 

## Interview Debriefs

Concluded each interview with an immediate 30-60-minute debrief to document on post-it notes key quotes, stories, and takeaways. Post-its were color coded as followed:

* Teal - knowledge and facts
* Rose - experiences
* Magenta - quotes
* Lime - ideas and suggestions
* Orange - questions
